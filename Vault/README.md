# Vault Package

Vault package that contains the library for the Vault app.
It's a Swift package that defines several targets, ultimately vended via `VaultiOS` to the application wrapper.

## Architecture

There's essentially 3 storage representations, which we encode and decode from.

To avoid exponential growth of encoders and decoders between all the formats, we always only encode and decode to the Application Layer `VaultItem`.
This gives us a common format and source of truth for fields that should be present in all the other formats.

## Key Derivation

Once defined, a key deriver's composition can never be changed for backwards compatibility.
Vault defines some standard key derivers that are used by default to create encryption keys for a variety of purposes.

In the case of a composition key deriver: the output at each step is directed as an input to the next step.

These derivers are benchmarked via `make benchmark-keygen`, so you can see their performance on your machine.

| Key Deriver Namespace        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vault.keygen.backup.fast`   | Derivation for vault export backups in non-optimized binary builds. Scaled-down parameters for all key derivation algorithms so they are a lot faster to compute. Still technically secure, but not for sustained offline attacks.                                                                                      |
| `vault.keygen.backup.secure` | Derivation for backups in optimized binary builds. Relatively slow to compute, even on an optimized build. Uses a variety of compute-hard and memory-hard key derivation algorithms. Designed to be resilient to sustained, long-term offline attacks to protect data in the event of the theft of an encrypted backup. |
| `vault.keygen.item.fast`     | Derivation for individual vault items in non-optimized binary builds. Scaled-down parameters for all derivations.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `vault.keygen.item.secure`   | Derivation for individual vault items in optimized binary builds. Designed to be relatively resilient to attacks, but much faster to keygen that the secure backup key, as this operation is preformed much more often.                                                                                                 |

## Testing Configuration

<table>
  <tr>
	<td>Simulator for snapshot tests</td>
	<td><b>iPhone 16 on iOS 18.0</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Simulator configuration, such as setting locale is covered by the use of test plans.
You shouldn't need to manually change the locale or any other simulator setting for the tests to pass.
