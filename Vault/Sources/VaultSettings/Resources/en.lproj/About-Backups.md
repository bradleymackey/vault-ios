Backups are crucial to ensure the safety and accessibility of your codes, as they are **exclusively stored on this device**. 
If this device is lost, damaged, or stolen, your data will be **irretrievably lost**, potentially locking you out of your accounts **permanently**.

## Where is my data stored?

Vault is a highly secure repository of your senstive data.

Any items you create in Vault are stored locally on your device and nowhere else.
They will not be sent anywhere automatically, including to your other devices.
Data is not sent to any server or stored in any cloud service, so it is your responsibility to keep your data safe.

## How can I keep my data safe?

To safeguard against data loss, Vault allows you to create secure backups of your codes. 
You can back up your codes by printing them on paper, which can then be stored securely offline in a safe or other secure location. 
This method ensures that you have a tangible, offline copy of your codes that is immune to digital threats.

For added security, all backups are required to be encrypted with a password. 
This encryption ensures that only you, or those you authorize, can restore the backup and access the codes. 
Without the correct password, the encrypted backup remains inaccessible, providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.

Backups are vital to ensure that your codes are safe and accessible, even in the event of device loss or damage.
