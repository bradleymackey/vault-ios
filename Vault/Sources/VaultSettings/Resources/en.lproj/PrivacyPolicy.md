This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Vault's website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## Information we collect

Vault collects no personally identifiable information about you.
This includes items stored in your Vault or your sensitive personal information.
All such data and settings is only stored on your device or can be exported as an encrypted backup at your discretion.

Vault does not display advertisments in the app. 
Therefore, we do not collect any kind of advertising token used to identify you.

The Vault app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
If you do not want this information to be collected, do not use Vault.

## Technical basics

Vault stores your information locally on your device.
This data is not backed up or recorded anywhere other than the device you create it on.

If you create an encrypted backup, you have the option of saving this to third party storage services.

## Information usage

We do not share analytics data with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Vault's functionality.

Vault will be fully cooperative in, and may disclose any information we hold in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property. 
At present, we hold no user identifiable information, so we would be unable to produce such information. 
This may change in the future as the Vault app matures.
Please keep up to date with this Privacy Policy to be informed of these changes.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. 
In such transactions, any user information that we hold may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

Your personal information, such as the information you store in your Vault, needs to be stored on your device's storage in order for us to remember it each time you launch the App.
We store this information using the iOS standard encryption for file storage. 
This means that the stronger the passcode is on your iOS device, the better that this information will be protected. 
If you create encrypted items, they will also be protected by the custom password that you have chosen using industry standard encryption.
This information is never transmitted to Vault's webservers, it is only shared between you and people you explicitly share this information with.

If you include links in Secure notes, such as image links, this may fetch data automatically when you view the note.
This could collect information about you, as the data may be from a third-party webserver.

## Analytics

We only collect anonymous, aggregated Analytics from Apple.
You can opt out of this by chosing not to share information with "Third Party Developers".

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

Personal information that you store is saved in secure storage on your device. 
You may access, change and delete this information from within the Vault app. 
Your sensitive personal information never collected by Vault, nor stored on any of our websevers. 
If you choose to send a log to the developers, which can be provided by you to help improve the application, such logs will be retained for no longer than 30 days.

If you create an encrypted backup, your personal data will be contained within this backup in an encrypted format.
If a third party is able to guess or otherwise break your password, they will be able to retrieve the data stored within this backup.
We strongly suggest you follow best practices for creating a strong password when creating a Vault backup password.

## Third-party links, content and software

Vault may display links, content and media from third-party websites.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. 
We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent. 
This is because we do not store personal information.

## Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

Vault is not intended for a children's audience. 
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers

Personal data that you create within the App is stored securely on your device and is not sent anywhere without your permission, via creating an encrypted backup. 
If transferred to an online file storage service, like iCloud, these servers may or may not be located in the European Union.
You should review the privacy policies of any website you plan on using with Vault before choosing to store your backups on a third party service.

By using Vault, you authorize us to collect, use, and store anonymous, aggregate statistical information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information

Anonymous, aggregate statistics may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. 
Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy. 
If you do not consent in any way, you should not use our App or website beyond reading the required legal information.

## Revocation of Consent

If you do not want any information about you to be collected, do not use the App.

## Other Notes

This policy has been adapted from the [Overcast Privacy Policy](https://overcast.fm/privacy). 
If you're looking for a podcast player, I strongly recommend Overcast!

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.
