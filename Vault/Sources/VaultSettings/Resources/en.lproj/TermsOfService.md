The App is currently only available on the iOS platform, distributed through Apple's iOS App Store (the "App Store").

This app is available for free.
Adjustments to pricing, specifically to a sale cost that is lower than the price the user originally purchased the App for, will not result in any form of compensation or reimburstment being issued for any reason.

The App's regional availability is determined by the regions where it is listed on the App Store.

There should be no expectation that other languages will be supported in the future. 
These terms and the Privacy Policy will only be published and will be available only in English.

The App is not guaranteed, nor is there an expectation that it will work on any version of iOS including: public, beta or pre-release versions of iOS. 
Help and support will never be provided for beta or pre-release versions of iOS. 
We retain the right to discontinue support for any portion of the iOS platform at any time, for any reason.
