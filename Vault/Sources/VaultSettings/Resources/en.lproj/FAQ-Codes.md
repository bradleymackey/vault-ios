Two-factor authentication (2FA) codes are a security measure used to enhance the protection of online accounts. 
They are typically a secondary form of verification, required in addition to your password, to confirm your identity when you log in.

## What's the point?

Even if someone knows your password, they cannot access your account without the 2FA code. 
This adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access.

Once setup, **only your device** knows how to generate these codes for your account. 
This means that you need physical access to this device to login to the account. 
The advantage of this is that if your username and password are compromised, a hacker still won't be able to login to your account because they don't have access to this device with your 2FA code.

## Compatibility

Vault supports "app-based" 2FA codes, which are generated by an authenticator app on your smartphone.
This is fully compatible with the most popular authenticator apps, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and Authy.
