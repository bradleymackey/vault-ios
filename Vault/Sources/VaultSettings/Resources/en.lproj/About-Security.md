Your data is always stored locally on device and encrypted whenever possible. 
Vault doesn't sync, share, or export your data unless you tell it to.

## End-to-End Encryption

All data in Vault is encrypted locally using industry-standard encryption. 

While stored on your device, data is encrypted using iOS's built-in full-disk encryption to protect your data from unauthorized access.
In order to make sure this is effective, you should set a strong passcode on your device.
If you do not have a passcode set on your device, your data will be vulnerable.

## Secure Backups

Vault allows you to create secure backups of your data, which can be stored offline in a safe or other secure location.
These backups are encrypted with a password, ensuring that only you, or those you authorize, can restore the backup and access the data.

## Minimal Attack Surface

By avoiding connections to external services (including avoiding ad networks, cloud backup services, payment networks and the web) and ensuring that all sensitive operations are conducted locally on your device, we significantly reduce potential vectors for attack.

## Open Source

Vault is fully open-source, allowing you to build the app from source, inspect the code, and verify that it meets your personal security standards.
Don't trust distributions of this software that are not from a trusted source.
