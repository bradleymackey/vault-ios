Your data is strictly confined to the device where you set them up, ensuring that they remain private and under your control at all times. 
This data is never automatically synced or shared with any other device or service without your explicit consent.

## End-to-End Encryption

All data within the app is encrypted locally using industry-standard encryption algorithms. 
This ensures that your data remains secure while stored on your device and that only you have access to it.

While stored on your device, data is encrypted using iOS's built-in full-disk encryption to protect your data from unauthorized access.
In order to make sure this is effective, you should set a strong passcode on your device.
If you do not have a passcode set on your device, your data will be vulnerable.

## Secure Backups

Vault allows you to create secure backups of your data, which can be stored offline in a safe or other secure location.
These backups are encrypted with a password, ensuring that only you, or those you authorize, can restore the backup and access the data.

## Minimal Attack Surface

By avoiding unnecessary connections to external services (including avoiding ad networks, cloud backup services, payment networks and the web) and ensuring that all sensitive operations are conducted locally on your device, we significantly reduce potential vectors for attack.

## Open Source

We understand that privacy and security are paramount, particularly for individuals with heightened security concerns. 
Vault is fully open-source, allowing you to build the app from source, inspect the code, and verify that it meets your personal security standards.
